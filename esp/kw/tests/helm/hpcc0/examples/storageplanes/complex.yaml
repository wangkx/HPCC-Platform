  #Some examples of the different kinds of storage planes that are supported
  #Store data on azure blobs
  - name: azureBlobPlane
    prefix: azure://ghallidaystorage      # Not sure if this should be different from the mount.
    secret: azure-ghallidaystorage

  - name: azureDllPlane
    prefix: azure://ghallidaydllstore      # Not sure if this should be different from the mount.
    secret: azure-ghallidaydllstore

  #Store data on aws s3 buckets
  - name: s3BucketPlane
    prefix: s3://...

  #Single node with data mounted, and mirror mounted at a different locations (could be a different disk)
  - name: localDataPlane
    prefix: /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-data
    replication: [ localMirrorPlane, localMirror2Plane ]
    pvc: "local-data-pvc"
  - name: localMirrorPlane
    prefix: /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-mirror
    pvc: "local-mirror-pvc"
  - name: localMirror2Plane
    prefix: /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-mirror2
    pvc: "local-mirror2-pvc"

  #Multiple nodes, data on a local mounts (all nodes mount the same logical file system).
  #Essentially identical to localDataPlane above
  - name: nasPlane
    prefix: /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-data
    replication: [ nasMirrorPlane ]
    pvc: "nas-data-pvc"
  - name: nasMirrorPlane
    prefix: /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-mirror
    pvc: "nas-mirror-pvc"

  #Multiple nodes, data on multiple local mounts (all nodes mount the same logical file system).
  #Allows an array of NFS servers to be used to store the data.  Would also potentially work for
  #local case with large numbers of local disks.
  #Mount point is /var/lib/hpccsystems/hpcc-data/d<device-number>

  # A locally mounted directory
